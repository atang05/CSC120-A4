Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Encapsulation made it necessary to write accessors for each class, which makes it clearer when accessing the information of one class in another class. 

Also, we don't have to worry about altering the interval information that should not change inside each class because we can only access these variables but not changing them. 

Additionally, encapsulation made it easier when compiling all the separate classes together. Because instead of having to know how each class work, I only have to understand what they do in order to use them. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
We followed the instructions step by step and found out that it's actually quite easy to write the methods inside each class. However, we find it somehow confusing when compiling all the classes in the train class as it requires us to know each class and their functions very well, and also have a very clear logic of how to apply each of them. We would like to advice new students to first make a mindmap before start writing the train class to help them better know the logic flow. Also, it is very important to read the readme file carefully before starting.
